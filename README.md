# BananaProxy
This is a basic proxy made for fun. IDK if it will be easy to implement but my goal is to make it available to deploy with codespaces.
To set up make a new CodeSpace and wait for it to load then type in npm install then npm install puppeteer then npm install express axios then node server.js and it should work
